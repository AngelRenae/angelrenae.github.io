    Variables in CSS are essential to any large-scale projects. If you have a set color scheme and are using the same
    group
    of colors over and over again in your site, instead of having to type it over and over again, you can create a
    variable
    to hold the color code. It also makes it much easier to change the color scheme of a site, since instead of editing
    each
    color value individually you can just change the value of the variable and everywhere it is used will reflect the
    change. This is done using the <code>var()</code> function, a built-in function. Like variables in Javascript, they
    can be local or
    global. For it to be local you’ll use the <code>var()</code> function on the inside of any selector you want it to
    be attached to
    while to make it global, the selector you’ll use is the <code>:root</code>.
    <code>:root</code> is a pseudo-selector that selects everything that the html selector would. The difference with
    this is that <code>:root</code>
    has a specificity of 10 compared to html’s specificity of 1.
    The structure you must follow to create a variable is <code>var(--variableName, value)</code>. The name of the
    variable has to start
    with <code>--</code>. Once the variable is declared, you’re able to use it throughout your code.
